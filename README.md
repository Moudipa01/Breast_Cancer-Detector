# Breast_Mitosis-Detector
![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IBM/MAX-Breast-Cancer-Mitosis-Detector.svg?branch=master)
## IBM Code Model Asset Exchange: Breast Cancer Mitosis Detector
> This repository contains code to instantiate and deploy the mitosis detection model.
 
> This model takes a 64 x 64 PNG image file extracted from the whole slide image as input, and outputs the predicted probability of the image containing mitosis. 

> For more information and additional features, check out the [samples](https://github.com/Moudipa01/Breast_Cancer-Detector/tree/main/samples).

> The code in this repository deploys the model as a web service in a Docker container.
